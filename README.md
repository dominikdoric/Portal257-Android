# About
Android application which is still in development phase. This application is imagined as some kind of local news application where all information that residents of village JakÅ¡iÄ‡ will need to see will be ind the one place. This way goal of this application is to modernise village and connect people even more.

# Arhitecture
The architecture of the application is based, apply and strictly complies with each of the following 5 points:
- A single-activity architecture
- Android architecture components, part of Android Jetpack for give to project a robust design, testable and maintainable.
- Pattern Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) facilitating a separation of development of the graphical user interface.
- S.O.L.I.D design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.
- Modular app architecture allows to be developed features in isolation, independently from other features.
